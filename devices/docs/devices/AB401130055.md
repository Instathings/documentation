## Notes


### Pairing
Follow instruction from [Manual reset](http://belkin.force.com/Articles/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting_and_Tutorials/Resetting-the-OSRAM-LIGHTIFY-Tunable-White-60-Bulb#a).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.


### Set default power on/off transition
Various Osram/Sylvania LED support setting a default transition when turning a light on and off.
```js
{
    "osram_set_transition": 0.1,            //time in seconds (integer or float)
}
```

### Remember current light state
Various Osram/Sylvania LED support remembering their current state in case of power loss, or if a light
is manually switched off then on. Lights will remember their respective attributes
(i.e. brightness, color, saturation, etc.).
NOTE: This must be executed everytime you make changes to a light's attributes for it to then 'remember' it.
```js
{
    "osram_remember_state": true,            // true, false (boolean)
}
```


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
