## Notes


### Power-on behavior
Allows to set the power-on behavior of the plug/bulb.
Note that this requires at least November/December '18 firmware update of the device.
```js
{
    "hue_power_on_behavior": "on",          // default, on, off, recover
    "hue_power_on_brightness": 125,         // same values as brightness
    "hue_power_on_color_temperature": 280,  // same values as color_temp
    "hue_power_on_color": "#0000FF",        // color in hex notation, e.g. #0000FF = blue

}
```

Attribute Value | Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------------
default         | reset to factory default value
on              | bulb on after power loss with configured brightness, color-temperature and color
off             | bulb off after power loss
recover         | last running state after power loss

Rules:
- `hue_power_on_behavior` value always has to be provided
- `hue_power_on_brightness`, `hue_power_on_color_temperature` and `hue_power_on_color` can only be provided when `hue_power_on_behavior` = `on`
- `hue_power_on_color_temperature` and `hue_power_on_color` cannot be provided together, only one can be set
- When setting `hue_power_on_behavior` = `on`, any not provided values will be reset to their factory defaults
