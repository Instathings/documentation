Keep clicking any button on the frontside of the device to keep device awake while pairing.
You should be clicking every two seconds until pairing is complete.

Device seems to join network also when it is paired directly to Airam bulb (which is joined to network already)
(https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/4713407.html) by keeping ON and DIM buttons pressed while holding remote
within 5 centimeters away from Airam bulb.
