## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the remote to Zigbee2mqtt by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the inside button, next to the CR2032 battery, 4 times.
The red light on the (front of the) remote will now flash a few times.


### Binding
The remote can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding) since firmware 2.3.014.
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. Use the group name as `TARGET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME`.
By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/[DEVICE_FRIENLDY_NAME]]` payload `default_bind_group`.

#### Note
This device with old firmware < 2.3.014 does not support binding (limitation of the device). A workaround is to first
get the group ID where the remote is sending it's commands to and add bulbs to the
same group ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/782#issuecomment-514526256)).

1. Pair the IKEA TRADRI remote control to Zigbee2mqtt.
2. Enable debug logging (log_level: debug) ([documentation](../information/configuration.md)).
3. You will get log output like this: `10/3/2019, 9:28:02 AM - debug: Received Zigbee message from '0x90fd9ffffe90d778'
of type 'commandToggle' with data '{}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 57173`.
4. Retrieve the group from the log output, which is `57173` in the above example.
5. Add this group to `configuration.yaml` and add your device (e.g.) bulb to this group.
([documentation](../information/groups.md)).


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


### Toggle button
When clicking the middle (center) button on the remote it will send a `{"click": "toggle"}`, when holding it
it will **also** send a `{"click": "toggle_hold"}`. It is not possible to skip the `toggle` when the button is hold.
Also the remote won't send anything when the button is released.
See [link](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2077#issuecomment-538691885) for more details.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
