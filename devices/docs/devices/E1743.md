## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the switch to Zigbee2mqtt by pressing the pair button (found under the back cover next to the battery)
4 times in a row. The red light on the front side should flash a few times and the turn off
(it's more visible to see the light from the back). After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate.
When connected, the light turns off.


### Binding
The E1743 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time and cannot be bound to a device.

By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/[DEVICE_FRIENLDY_NAME]]` payload `default_bind_group`.


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
