## Notes


### Important
These devices can only be used on channel 26.
These devices are locked to the manufacturer's network key (ext_pan_id).
Your configuration file [data/configuration.yaml](../information/configuration) must contain the following:

```yaml
advanced:
  ext_pan_id: [33,117,141,25,0,75,18,0]
  channel: 26
```

Therefore these devices may not co-existence with other Zigbee devices.
Maybe, you need to add a dedicated coordinator and create a new network for Livolo.
If you decided to create a new network, you should specify another 'pan_id'.

```yaml
advanced:
  pan_id: 6756
```

manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
