## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold the setup button on the rear of the device for +- 10 seconds (until the green light goes solid)
to initiate pairing. Please note that the pairing indicator light is below the main sensor
(as oppose to the obvious indicator above the main sensor).


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `illuminance_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate illuminance values,
e.g. `95` would take 95% to the illuminance reported by the device; default `100`.


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


### Motion sensitivity
The motion sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`
`{"motion_sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITVITIY` is one of the following
values: `low`,  `medium`,  `high` (default).

### Occupany timeout
Sets the sensors timeout between last motion detected and sensor reports occupance false
```js
{
    // Value >= 0,
    // 0 - 10: 10sec (min possible timeout)
    //   > 10: timeout in sec
    // (must be written to (default) endpoint 2)
    "occupancy_timeout": 0,
}
```


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
