## Notes


### Device pairing/installation
To put the TRV in installation mode twist and hold the cap in the  **+** direction
until the central LED flashes green.  The device is ready for joining when:

- left/right LEDs flash red/blue
- central LED shows a solid orange

If central light shows a solid green, your TRV has been paired and is connected to the zigbee network.

If blinking with yellow, then your TRV is not paired or can't connect to the zigbee network. If Zigbee2MQTT is running and accepting new devices the valve should join the network. Sometimes you may need to twist and hold the cap in the **+** direction for 3 seconds before it will try to join.

**Note:** Zigbee2MQTT might not be able to correctly configure the TRV until you have [calibrated](#calibrate) it.

If the valve is not recognized, you can turn the boost button to positive and hold it; the red light starts to blink slowly. Release the button once the red light stops blinking.

### Calibrate
After installing the TRV twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold for
2 seconds until the blue LED lights up.

### Device hard reset
If the device fails to pair/join the network (`red:yellow:blue` on paring mode) or you changed the network id/channel, connect to another network, bought the TRV second hand, you can perform a factory reset to start fresh.

1. Make sure that the TRV is NOT in pairing mode.
2. Twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold till blue light turns off and then center light blinks red (about 15 seconds).
3. Release the button, you should see a `red:gree:blue` short flash; the valve will go into installation mode.

### Controlling

Valve sometimes fails to respond/acknowledge a setting, just send the command again.

- Get local temperature in degrees Celsius.
    ```json
    {
        "local_temperature": ""
    }
    ```

- Get or set occupied heating setpoint to *&lt;temperature&gt;* in degrees Celsius. Possible values: 7 to 30 by default; leave empty to read.
    ```json
    {
        "occupied_heating_setpoint": "<temperature>"
    }
    ```

- Get or set the keypad lock, i.e. enable/disable twist-top boost. Possible values: "unlock", "lock1". **WARNING** Setting the keypad to lock (i.e. "lock1") disables the twist-top boost button which impedes setting the valve to installation mode or hard-reseting it.
    ```json
    {
        "keypad_lockout": ""
    }
    ```

- Get the battery level, in percentage. Possible values 0 to 100 (%). The level corresponds voltages in the range 2.2 V (0%) to 3.0 V (100%). The levels where chosen so a 0% indicates that batteries must be replaced, but the valve will still work.
    ```json
    {
        "battery": ""
    }
    ```

- Get the battery voltage. Possible values 0.0 to 3.0 (V). This is a direct measure of the battery voltage.
    ```json
    {
        "voltage": ""
    }
    ```

- Get the (latest) twist-top boost state. Possible values:

    | Attribute Value | Description |
    | -----------------|----------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 | Boost up |
    | 0 | No boost |
    | -1 | Boost down |

    Note that the valve will not automatically toggle the value to 0 after some time, i.e. configuration/automation logic is needed to use the value. E.g. in Home Assistant the `expire_after` setting can be used to handle this.

- Get the valve position / heating demand. Will report the valve position or heating amount depending. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    ```json
    {
        "pi_heating_demand": ""
    }
    ```
- Get the valve motor state. Possible values: "Stall", others. String description of the motor state. Seems to change when the motor is moving.
    ```json
    {
        "MOT": ""
    }
    ```
- Get the Zigbee link quality. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    ```json
    {
        "linkquality": ""
    }
    ```


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
