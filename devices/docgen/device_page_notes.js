### Pairing
Additional steps are required because the Peanut Smart Plug does not provide a \`modelId\` in its database entry,

Reset the device and initiate pairing mode by holding the pairing button
(the small button next to the on/off button) for ten seconds, releasing the button,
and unplugging the device.
When plugged back in, the front LED will be blinking red and ready to receive a pairing request.
When paired successfully, the red LED on the plug will stop blinking.

After pairing, you must stop zigbee2mqtt and manually edit the zigbee2mqtt \`database.db\` file with a
text editor (note that the file may be owned by root).
Find each line where the Peanut Smart Plug is listed (look for "SecuriFi Ltd." in the \`ManufName\` field)
and **add** \`"modelId":"PP-WHT-US",\` between two existing fields.

*For example,* change \`..."manufId":4098,"manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`
to \`..."manufId":4098,"modelId":"PP-WHT-US","manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`

### Pairing
Philips LivingColors IRIS and Philips LivingColors Bloom Devices that comes with
Philips (HUE) Remote Gen 2 (Touch Wheel) or Gen 3 (Round Click Wheel) can be paired via Zigbee.
Devices with Gen 1 Remote don't use Zigbee and can not be paired.
The Philips LivingColors Remote can not be paired via Zigbee because it only support ZigBee Light Link (ZLL).

To Pair hold Button ON and Bottom Left Key (Favorite 1) on the Remote in Front of the Device until
the Device Light blinks and lights Orange. If connection was succesfull the Device Light will light Green.

**WARNING**: If you pair your Device to a Zigbee Network which is not using a ZLL Channel
you can't reset the Device with the Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 3.
The Gen 3 Remote will only try ZLL Channels to find the Device! Maybe it's possible to reset
the Device with a Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 2 as it should try all Zigbee Channels to find the Device.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting \`debounce\` option with \`debounce_ignore: - action\` to throttle them without loosing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
\`\`\`
{% endraw %}

To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding \`brightness\` to \`debounce_ignore\` option

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness
\`\`\`
{% endraw %}

### Binding
The remote can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding) since firmware 2.3.014.
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. Use the group name as \`TARGET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME\`.
By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to \`zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/[DEVICE_FRIENLDY_NAME]]\` payload \`default_bind_group\`.

#### Note
This device with old firmware < 2.3.014 does not support binding (limitation of the device). A workaround is to first
get the group ID where the remote is sending it's commands to and add bulbs to the
same group ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/782#issuecomment-514526256)).

1. Pair the IKEA TRADRI remote control to Zigbee2mqtt.
2. Enable debug logging (log_level: debug) ([documentation](../information/configuration.md)).
3. You will get log output like this: \`10/3/2019, 9:28:02 AM - debug: Received Zigbee message from '0x90fd9ffffe90d778'
of type 'commandToggle' with data '{}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 57173\`.
4. Retrieve the group from the log output, which is \`57173\` in the above example.
5. Add this group to \`configuration.yaml\` and add your device (e.g.) bulb to this group.
([documentation](../information/groups.md)).

First you probably want to unbind it from the coordinator first, then you can bind it to any other device or group. (see https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/binding.html )

As the device is sleeping by default, you need to wake it up after sending the bind/unbind command by pressing the reset button once.

When bound to a lamp, the behavior is as follows:
- left click: turn off
- right click: turn on
- left double click: light dim down (by steps of 33%)

* \`no_occupancy_since\`: Timeout (in seconds) after \`no_occupancy_since\` is send.
This indicates the time since last occupancy was detected.
For example \`no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]\` will send a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 10}\` after 10 seconds
and a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 60}\` after 60 seconds.
* \`occupancy_timeout\`: Timeout (in seconds) after the \`occupancy: false\` message is sent.
If not set, the timeout is \`90\` seconds.
When set to \`0\` no \`occupancy: false\` is send.

**IMPORTANT**: \`occupancy_timeout\` should not be set to lower than 60 seconds.
The reason is this: after detecting a motion the sensor ignores any movements for
exactly 60 seconds. In case there are movements after this, a new message
(\`occupancy: true\`) will be sent and the sensor will go for one more minute sleep, and so on.
This is expected behaviour (see [#270](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/270#issuecomment-414999973)).
To work around this, a
[hardware modification](https://community.smartthings.com/t/making-xiaomi-motion-sensor-a-super-motion-sensor/139806)

### Controlling
*Current heating setpoint*
\`\`\`json
{
    "current_heating_setpoint": 21.5
}
\`\`\`
Current heating setpoint is also modified when occupied or unoccupied heating setpoint is set.

*System mode*

The system mode will be either \`off\`, \`auto\`, or \`heat\`. When set to \`heat\` the boost host flags will be set, when using \`off\` the window_open hostflag will be set (and off will be displayed on the display).

*Eurotronic host flags*

The \`eurotronic_host_flags\` property contains an object with a true/false field for each host option.

\`\`\`json
{
  "eurotronic_host_flags": {
    "mirror_display": false,
    "boost": false,
    "window_open": false,
    "child_protection": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can toggle these flags by publishing a message to the \`set\` mqtt topic containing \`eurotronic_host_flags\`. e.g. enabling the display mirroring:
\`\`\`json
{"eurotronic_host_flags": {"mirror_display": true}}
\`\`\`

**Note that \`true\` or \`false\` do not have quotes aroud them!**

*Eurotronic system mode*

**This is deprecated in favor of eurotronic_host_flags, but will still work for now.**

This is a bitmap encoded field to set several device specific features. Please remind it is not possible to set single bits, always the full bitmap is written. Bit 0 doesnt seem to be writeable, it is always reported as set, so expect your written value + 1 to be reported.

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | unknown (default 1)
1 | Mirror display
2 | Boost
3 | unknown
4 | disable window open
5 | set window open (is reported as disable window open)
6 | unknown
7 | Child protection

Examples for eurotronic_system_mode:

Mirror display, reported as 3
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 2
}
\`\`\`
signal external window open, current_heating_setpoint will report "5", device display shows "OFF"
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 32
}
\`\`\`
signal external window close, will restore last current_heating_setpoint value
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 16
}
\`\`\`
Mirror display and set child protection.
\`\`\`json
{

### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` various device attributes can be configured:

        "windowCoveringType": xxx,
        "configStatus": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitLiftCm": xxx,

        "startupSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5. Window Covering Cluster (Server)".

As an alternative to the attributes listed above, the following properties may be used for convenience:
* \`open_to_closed_s\`: corresponds to \`totalSteps\`, but takes value in seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`closed_to_open_s\`: ditto for \`totalSteps2\`,
* \`lift_to_tilt_transition_ms\`: sets both \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps\` and \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps2\`
(they shall both be equal according to ubisys manual), but takes value in *milli*seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`steps_per_second\`: factor to be used for conversion, defaults to 50 full AC waves per second if not provided

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get/configure_j1\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal zigbee2mqtt log.

### Calibration
By publishing \`{"configure_j1": {"calibrate": 1}}\` to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` the device can also be
calibrated after installation to support more advanced positioning features
(i.e. go to lift percentage / go to tilt percentage). This can be combined with setting attributes as shown above,
for example:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "calibrate" : 1,
        "windowCoveringType": 8,
        "lift_to_tilt_transition_ms": 1600
    }
}
\`\`\`
The calibration procedure will move the shutter up and down several times and the current stage of the
calibration process will again be logged to the normal zigbee2mqtt log for the user to get some feedback.
For details on the calibration procedure please again take a look at
the [ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5.1. Calibration".
Please note that tilt transition steps cannot be determined automatically and must therefore be
configured manually for the device to also support "go to tilt percentage". One possibility to determine the
correct value is to take a video of the blinds moving from 0 to 100 percent tilt and then getting the exact timing
from the video by playing it slow motion.

### Home Assistant cover features when using [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant)
The cover will be offered to Home Assistant as supporting lift and tilt by default, but for covers with reduced
functionality this can be passed along to Home Assistant by disabling some of the topics in \`configuration.yaml\`,
for example:
\`\`\`yaml
'0x001fee0000001234':

0               | 0 – Simple/setpoint mode. This mode means the thermostat setpoint is altered only by manual up/down changes at the thermostat or remotely, not by internal schedule programming. <br> 1 – Schedule programming mode. This enables or disables any programmed weekly schedule configurations. <br> Note: It does not clear or delete previous weekly schedule programming configurations.
1               | 0 - Auto/recovery mode set to OFF <br> 1 – Auto/recovery mode set to ON

### Important
There are 3 versions of this device: Standalone, Zigbee and Z-wave. These are visualy identical. Make sure to get the correct version that will work with zigbee2mqtt:

Supported:
- **HS1SA-M : Zigbee**

Unsupported:
- HS1SA : Standalone
- HS1SA-Z : Z-wave

The product code should end in *-M* for the Zigbee version. The label inside the battery compartment should also show the Zigbee logo.

    {
        model: 'WV704R0A0902',
        note: `
### Device pairing/installation
To put the TRV in installation mode twist and hold the cap in the  **+** direction
until the central LED flashes green.  The device is ready for joining when:

- left/right LEDs flash red/blue
- central LED shows a solid orange

If central light shows a solid green, your TRV has been paired and is connected to the zigbee network.

If blinking with yellow, then your TRV is not paired or can't connect to the zigbee network. If Zigbee2MQTT is running and accepting new devices the valve should join the network. Sometimes you may need to twist and hold the cap in the **+** direction for 3 seconds before it will try to join.

**Note:** Zigbee2MQTT might not be able to correctly configure the TRV until you have [calibrated](#calibrate) it.

If the valve is not recognized, you can turn the boost button to positive and hold it; the red light starts to blink slowly. Release the button once the red light stops blinking.

### Calibrate
After installing the TRV twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold for
2 seconds until the blue LED lights up.

### Device hard reset
If the device fails to pair/join the network (\`red:yellow:blue\` on paring mode) or you changed the network id/channel, connect to another network, bought the TRV second hand, you can perform a factory reset to start fresh.

1. Make sure that the TRV is NOT in pairing mode.
2. Twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold till blue light turns off and then center light blinks red (about 15 seconds).
3. Release the button, you should see a \`red:gree:blue\` short flash; the valve will go into installation mode.

### Controlling

Valve sometimes fails to respond/acknowledge a setting, just send the command again.

- Get local temperature in degrees Celsius.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "local_temperature": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set occupied heating setpoint to *&lt;temperature&gt;* in degrees Celsius. Possible values: 7 to 30 by default; leave empty to read.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "occupied_heating_setpoint": "<temperature>"
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set the keypad lock, i.e. enable/disable twist-top boost. Possible values: "unlock", "lock1". **WARNING** Setting the keypad to lock (i.e. "lock1") disables the twist-top boost button which impedes setting the valve to installation mode or hard-reseting it.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "keypad_lockout": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery level, in percentage. Possible values 0 to 100 (%). The level corresponds voltages in the range 2.2 V (0%) to 3.0 V (100%). The levels where chosen so a 0% indicates that batteries must be replaced, but the valve will still work.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "battery": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery voltage. Possible values 0.0 to 3.0 (V). This is a direct measure of the battery voltage.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "voltage": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the (latest) twist-top boost state. Possible values:

    | Attribute Value | Description |
    | -----------------|----------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 | Boost up |
    | 0 | No boost |
    | -1 | Boost down |

    Note that the valve will not automatically toggle the value to 0 after some time, i.e. configuration/automation logic is needed to use the value. E.g. in Home Assistant the \`expire_after\` setting can be used to handle this.

- Get the valve position / heating demand. Will report the valve position or heating amount depending. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "pi_heating_demand": ""
    }
    \`\`\`
- Get the valve motor state. Possible values: "Stall", others. String description of the motor state. Seems to change when the motor is moving.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "MOT": ""
    }
    \`\`\`
- Get the Zigbee link quality. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "linkquality": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

        note: `
### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
\`\`\`

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

\`\`\` yaml
- id: auto_publish_outdoor_temp
  description: publish the outdoor temperature to Stelpro thermostat
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.outdoor_sensor_temperature
      condition: []
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data_template:
      payload: '{{ states(trigger.entity_id) }}'
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/THERMOSTAT_FRIENDLY_NAME/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature'
\`\`\`

**IMPORTANT**: The outdoor temperature need to be refreshed at least each 4 hours, or the \`EXT\` display will be cleared on the thermostat.
