In this tutorial we will show how to connect a Philips Hue bulb and control it with Instathings.

Before starting make sure you have followed the previous tutorials to:
- <a href="/docs/connect-raspberry.html" class="external-link">connect your gateway</a>
- <a href="docs/flashing-dongle.html" class="external-link">configure your Zigbee dongle</a>. 

Of course you will also need to connect the Zigbee USB dongle to the gateway device.

## Connect a Philiphs Hue bulb

### Install Zigbee protocol in your gateway
First of all you need to install the Zigbee software into your gateway. 

This can be easily done in our Editor: 
- navigate in your gateway detail page
- click on the `install` button of the Zigbee protocol
- `installed` will appear as soon as the gateway completes the installation

### Create the subdevice
Now go back to the devices page and create a new subdevice. 

Give it a name and choose its type, in this case we used the model `Philips - Hue white and color ambiance - 9290012573A`

### Pair the subdevice
Once you create a subdevice you'll see its detail page. 

Now you have to pair your device to you gateway by clicking on the airplane button on the right side of the page. 

**Be aware!** Before start pairing your Philips Hue bulb turn it on and bring it close to the USB dongle less than 10 cm (~ 3 inch). This will allow the bulb to join the Zigbee network managed by the coordinator. 

After a moment you shold see the bulb blinking 3 times, this means that the device has been succesfully paired! This will also confirmed in the Editor.

- click `Enable API access` button. 
<br>For more information about API access refer to our
<a href="https://developers.instathings.io/" class="external-link">API documentation</a>. 

Anyway you don't need to any have technical background to follow this tutorial.

</a>

You just need to copy the following informations to use them in the next step. They are all available in the `Settings` page:
 - `Base url for API access`
 - `Client ID`
 - `Client Secret`  

 Now go back to the `Devices` page, select your Light Bulb subdevice and copy the `device ID`, you will need it in the following step togheter with the settings information. 

 Now you are ready to control the bulb! 

### Change bulb state 
 Go to the Light Bulb Demo Application and fill the form with the information of your project and your device.
 
 Then set the payload with the parameters you want to control, for example using the following payload the light will turn into blue!
 
 ```javascript
 {
	"state": "ON",
	"color": {
		"x": 0.150,
		"y": 0.005
	},
	"brightness": 255
}
 ```
