Within your project you can also find the `Automations` page. Automations allows to move data generated by your IoT device to a third party service using workflows.

## Create a new automation
Let's create a new automation to better understand what *automation* means in Instathings and what you can do with them.  
Click on `New Automation`, choose a name and you will be redirected to the automation details page.

### Trigger
The first part is related to the *trigger* that starts the automation flow. You have to choose the device on which you want to trigger some action. Then you can choose whether to react on `data`, coming from the device itself, or react on `alarm` you have previously configured. 

### Actions
The second part shows up as long as you save the `When this happens...` window and is realated to what action has to be triggered. In this section all the third party services we support are shown, that are where you can move your data. 
Choose your application, insert your credentials and fill all the fiedls.

By clicking on the right side button in the `Text` field you can select which data generated by your device you want send to your application.

Click `Continue` and enable your automation by clicking on the switch on top of the page.
