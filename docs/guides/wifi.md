Instathings supports every device able to receive an HTTP request and reply with `application/json` content type.

In this tutorial we will show you how to integrate a device that supports HTTP APIs with Instathings.

It will take about 5 minutes, let's get started!

## Requirements

Before you start you need a configured Gateway and a smart device which is reachable from the Gateway. 
If you haven't configured a Gateway yet, you can go back to the <a href="/docs/guides/gateway-setup.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">previous tutorial</a> and set it up!

How to connect your device to your network varies based on the device, refer to the manufacturer documentation for this. 

In this guide we will use a [Shelly Plug S](https://shelly.cloud/shelly-plug-s/). 

## Pair a device

Once your Gateway is connected, if it has native WiFi protocol, you can start pairing your device. 

Go to the `Hubs` page, move to the `Devices` tab, fill the `Add Device` form and choose `HTTP-DEVICE` as model.

Click on create.

</a>

### Pair time!

To pair your device you have to provide some information about its network configuration:
* `Protocol`: you can choose the connection protocol among `http` and `https`
* `Hostname`: a valid IP address or hostname your device is reachable to
* `Port`: the port which your device is listening on

</a>

Fill the form, click `Pair` and in a few seconds you should see the Paired message popping up. Good job!

## Instathings API 

You can now send HTTP requests to your device via Instathings. 

Usually to read/set status of a device through Instathings two steps are needed:
1. identify the device endpoint
2. call the endpoint via Instathings

Step 1 is usually achieved by referring to the manufacturer provided API reference. 

Step 2 will leverage two Instathings API that allows you to read or set the device status. 

To cover our case we refer to:
- the Shelly [API reference](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/#shelly-plug-plugs) 
- the [control a device](https://developers.instathings.io/#control-a-device-by-id) and the [get status](https://developers.instathings.io/#get-device-status-by-id) API endpoints


### Get device status

####¬†Identify the device endpoint
In order to know the status of a a Shelly Plug S we'll call the device `/status` [endpoint](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/#shelly-plug-plugs-status).

####¬†Call the endpoint via Instathings

To use the Instathings API to retrieve the device status we'll to call the [Get device status by id](https://developers.instathings.io/#get-device-status-by-id).

Instathings HTTP request will be a POST the `/device/v1/control/:deviceId/` endpoint as follows:

```bash
curl -XPOST \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer abc.def.ghi' \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
-H 'instathings-path: /status' \
-H 'instathings-method: GET' \
'https://yourProjectName.instathings.io/device/v1/control/:yourDeviceId/status'
```

Note that you need to set the following headers:
* `instathings-path`: in which you have to specify the relative path of your device endpoint
* `intathings-method`: the HTTP method needed to call your device endpoint

In the response headers you will find a `location` header whose value is the path you have to call with a `GET` to retrieve the status of your device

```bash
curl -XGET \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer abc.def.ghi' \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
https://yourProjectName.instathings.io/device/v1/control/:requestId/fetch
```

Voil√†. We retrieved the status of the smart plug.


### Change device status

####¬†Identify the device endpoint

To turn the plug on/off we need to call the `/relay/0` [endpoint](https://developers.instathings.io/#control-a-device-by-id) with the `turn` query parameter.

####¬†Call the endpoint via Instathings

To use the Instathings API to change the device status we'll to call the [Control device status by id](https://developers.instathings.io/#control-a-device-by-id).

So we have to call the Instathings endpoint `/device/v1/control/:deviceId/set` to set the status of a device as follows:

```bash
curl -XPOST \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer abc.def.ghi' \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
-H 'instathings-path: /relay/0' \
-H 'instathings-method: GET' \
'https://yourProjectName.instathings.io/device/v1/control/:yourDeviceId/set?turn=on'
```

You need to set the headers:
* `instathings-path`: in which you have to specify the relative path of your device endpoint
* `intathings-method`: the http method needed for your device endpoint

And the query parameters (due to the particular Shelly API)
* `turn` 

There you go, you just changed the status of the smart plug.
