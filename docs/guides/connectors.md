Within your project you can also find the `Connectors` page. Connectors allows to move data generated by your IoT device to a third party service using workflows.

## Set up a new connector
Let's create a new connector to better understand what it means in Instathings and what you can do with them.  
Choose a name for your workflow, click on `Create` and the flows details will show up.

### Trigger
The first part is related to the *trigger* that starts the connector flow. You have to choose the device on which you want to trigger some action. Then you can choose whether to react on `data. 

### Actions
The second part shows up as long as you save the `When this happens...` window and is realated to what action has to be triggered. In this section all the third party services we support are shown, that are where you can move your data. 
Choose your application, insert your credentials and fill all the fiedls.

By clicking on the right side button in the `Text` field you can select which data generated by your device you want send to your application.

Click `Continue` and enable your flow by clicking on the switch on top of the page.
