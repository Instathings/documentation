Sandbox allows you to create a project using virtual devices and demo data. This is the fastest way to test your ideas and start building a custom IoT app with Instathings.

## 1. Create a Project

1. From the main page, click on 'New Project', 
2. Assign a name to the project,
3. Select _Sandbox_ from the Environment drop-down.

</a>

The Gateway you just created is virtual but acts as a real one. In particular, it supports three different wireless protocols: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee. If you were working with a real Gateway, you would install the protocols that you want to use to connect your devices.

Virtual devices act like real ones: they must be activated before they send start sending data.
1. Click the button 'Start sending data' in the device detail page

## 4. Inspect data

Once the device is paired with the Gateway and it starts sending data, you can inspect the payload.
1. Click on 'Data' in the top menu,
2. Select a device from the drop-dowm menu,
3. Click on the "eye" icon to inspect the data sent by the sensor
