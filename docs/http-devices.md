title: Supported HTTP devices
---

Instathings supports any HTTP device that exposes REST API with a JSON payload to control.

As an example you can use devices from [Shelly](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/) or [Sonoff](http://developers.sonoff.tech/) seamlessly using the manufacturer APIs through Instathings Cloud.
